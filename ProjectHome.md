Provides Implementation and Explanation of many Algorithms

# Academic Algorithms #

  * Implement Bubble Sort (Visually)
  * Implement Insertion Sort (Visually)
  * Implement Quick Sort (Visually)
  * Implement Merge Sort (Visually)
  * Implement Binary Search
  * Implement an AVL Tree
  * Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome?
  * Write a function to insert integers into a linked list in a sorted manner?
  * Write a function to delete a node from a binary search tree?

# Interview Algorithms #
  * Count no of 1s in a number
  * Find Duplicates in an Array
  * In the given array, find the subsequence with maximum sum and minimum length. E.g. [10,25,-23,40,-12,39,7] The subsequence [39,7] has sum of 46 with length 2.
  * Write an algorithm to compress a text file
  * You are given a list of strings of 0s and 1s. E.g. 10, 110, 01001, ... Devise an algorithm to check if any of the stringis a prefix of another one.
  * Given 2 strings, both the strings are again a sequences of 0s and 1s, write an algorithm to find if one is a substring of another.
  * Write an algorithm for finding the word count in a string / file
  * Given a sentence (e.g. "i like green applies"), write a program to reverse the words in the sentence (result: "apples green like i"). The optimal solution is O(n)
  * Given two strings, write a function that would print characters in the first string that are not in the second string and also print characters in the second string that are not in the first string.
  * Which is faster: finding an item in a hashtable or in a sorted list?
